WordFlipper
===========

A small & simple Android library for anyone who likes to create an effect of flipping letters in a word.
The library contains a WordFlipper class that extends from LinearLayout and can be added to any layout through XML or programmatically.
Some attributes (like letters background and size, animation duration) can be changed by overriding the needed resources in your app.
